<html><body><p>I am off to <a href="http://www.hp.com.au/igf2015">IGF</a> Melbourne today so just a short post.  The other day I introduced <a href="/blog/2015/7/29/fun-with-82-low-impact-css-webdrawer-customisation">custom_head</a>, which allows us to inject code into the WebDrawer HTML head element.  I omitted to mention that there is also custom_scripts.cshtml.  This allows you to inject code after the WebDrawer scripts at the bottom of the page.  The top of the page is typically the place to load styles and the bottom the place to load scripts.</p></body></html>
