<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Spending most of my days alone in an office I love the occasions when I get to meet some of the people who use CM.  One of the most enjoyable experiences is hearing directly from people who need a particular fix/feature and then being able to go back to my office and make that happen.</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I, along with various other CM developers, will be at <a href="http://www.cvent.com/events/micro-focus-realize-2019/event-summary-5bba781887724c018bddd4143e3fc570.aspx?RefID=SalesIMG">Realize</a> this year, I will not venture beyond Melbourne but members from the dev team will be at all the Realize events.</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Come along, tell us your stories and shine a light into the long lonely months in the office.</p>
