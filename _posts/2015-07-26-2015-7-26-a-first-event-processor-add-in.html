<h1>Event processor add-in?</h1>
<p>The HPRM workgroup server processes a variety of scheduled events, such as word indexing and notifications.  It is possible for you to create your own custom add-ins to be triggered by one of the many record (or other object) events. I have written an <a href="/blog/2015/6/18/my-first-hprm-sdk-application">intro to HPRM SDK programming</a> in a previous post.</p>
<h1>Getting started</h1>
<p>This is a video of me creating a simple event processor add-in.</p>

<h1>Basic debugging tips</h1>
<p>It can be difficult to work out why a program like an event processor add-in is not working.  These are some of the strategies I use:</p>
<ul>
<li>write log entries from your code to verify where (or whether) your code us running,</li>
<li>use the debugger to verify that you are at least getting to the first line of your code,</li>
<li>start again, write the simplest possible add-in (like the one above) and bit by bit build your code up again until you work out where it is going wrong,</li>
<li>double check you are using the correct version of the HPRM SDK, and</li>
<li>don't forget to use the 'Test' button in HPRM Enterprise studio.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any other tips please put them in the comments below.</p>
