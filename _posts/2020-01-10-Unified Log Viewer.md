The various Content Manager components have a variety of formats making it a non-trivial task to get a unified view of what is happening across the ecosystem. This [plugin](https://github.com/content-manager-sdk/Community/tree/master/Support/UnifiedLogViewer) for [Tailviewer](https://kittyfisto.github.io/Tailviewer/) smooths out the differences making it easier to diagnose issues that span more than one component (e.g. web service and workgroup server).
