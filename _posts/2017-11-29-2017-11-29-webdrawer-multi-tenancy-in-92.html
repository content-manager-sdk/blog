<p>WebDrawer has not changed a lot in 92, one of the enhancements is the ability to run multiple instances of WebDrawer out of the same installation.  Prior to this it was required to copy the WeDrawer program folder and create a new IIS Application.  The new IIS Application is still required but the copied WebDrawer binaries can be avoided,</p>
