<p>If you create one of more Search Form objects in RM these will be incorporated into the WebDrawer search page, as a drop down list of custom search pages.  It is possible to customise the properties that are displayed in the search results for these pages, the trick is that different versions of WebDrawer require different customisations.  This video details customising in 82 and earlier and also in 83 and later.</p>
