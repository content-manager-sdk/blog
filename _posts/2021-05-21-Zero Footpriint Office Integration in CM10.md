The Content Manager 10 zero footprint office integration is made up of several components.  The two videos here demonstrate configuring Azure AD and uploading the Office manifest.  In the video I refer to is as the Word manifest but it is the manifest to support Word, Excel and PowerPoint. The first video finishes with the manifest uploaded but not working, in the second video I show the mistakes I made and also the techniques I used to troubleshoot them.
