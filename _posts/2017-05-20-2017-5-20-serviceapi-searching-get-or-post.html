<p>It had been in the back of my mind that using HTTP GET for searching in a project I was working on would lead to trouble and several hours of re-factoring later I am proved correct.</p>
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>The default way we do searching in the ServiceAPI is using HTTP GET, for example:</p>
<pre class="source-code">http://localhost/ServiceAPI/Record?pageSize=20<span class="cm-error">&amp;q</span>=all<span class="cm-error">&amp;filter</span>=extension:docx,xlsx<span class="cm-error">&amp;properties</span>=RecordTitle<span class="cm-error">&amp;format</span>=json</pre>
<p>There are several advantages to use the GET verb but there is also a trap which is that IIS has limitations on the length of a URL.  Usually this is not a problem and the ServiceAPI has design features to help keep URLs concise (such as custom property sets) however I encountered a scenario where I could not avoid the IIS error resulting from an overlong URL.</p>
<h1>The scenario</h1>
<p>The scenario that caught me was needing the flexibility for the end user to specify as many properties in the properties query parameter as they desired and I did not want to use the 'all' property set as I did not want the cost of fetching every record property.  If the user chose too many properties their request would fail.</p>
<h1>The solution</h1>
<p>The solution is that the ServiceAPI allows you to POST the same request that you usually GET, you just have to post it to a different end point.  There are a couple of examples of this using an form post and AJAX in the documentation, here is an example using the .Net client.</p>
<pre class="source-code"><span class="cm-tag">TrimClient</span> <span class="cm-tag">client</span> = <span class="cm-tag">new</span> <span class="cm-tag">TrimClient</span>(<span class="cm-string">"http://localhost/ServiceAPI"</span>);
<span class="cm-tag">client</span><span class="cm-qualifier">.Credentials</span> = <span class="cm-tag">System</span><span class="cm-qualifier">.Net</span><span class="cm-qualifier">.CredentialCache</span><span class="cm-qualifier">.DefaultNetworkCredentials</span>;


<span class="cm-tag">PostSearch</span> <span class="cm-tag">request</span> = <span class="cm-tag">new</span> <span class="cm-tag">PostSearch</span>();
<span class="cm-tag">request</span><span class="cm-qualifier">.TrimType</span> = <span class="cm-tag">BaseObjectTypes</span><span class="cm-qualifier">.Record</span>;
<span class="cm-tag">request</span><span class="cm-qualifier">.q</span> = <span class="cm-string">"all"</span>;
<span class="cm-tag">request</span><span class="cm-qualifier">.Properties</span> = <span class="cm-tag">new</span> <span class="cm-tag">PropertyList</span>(<span class="cm-tag">PropertyIds</span><span class="cm-qualifier">.RecordTitle</span>, <span class="cm-tag">PropertyIds</span><span class="cm-qualifier">.RecordNumber</span>);

<span class="cm-tag">var</span> <span class="cm-tag">response</span> = <span class="cm-tag">client</span><span class="cm-qualifier">.ServiceClient</span><span class="cm-qualifier">.Send</span>&lt;<span class="cm-tag">RecordsResponse</span>&gt;(<span class="cm-string">"POST"</span> , <span class="cm-string">"Search"</span>, <span class="cm-tag">request</span>);

<span class="cm-tag">foreach</span> (<span class="cm-tag">Record</span> <span class="cm-tag">rec</span> <span class="cm-tag">in</span> <span class="cm-tag">response</span><span class="cm-qualifier">.Results</span>)
{
    <span class="cm-property cm-error">Console</span><span class="cm-error">.WriteLine</span>(<span class="cm-property cm-error">rec</span><span class="cm-error">.Title</span>);
}</pre>
