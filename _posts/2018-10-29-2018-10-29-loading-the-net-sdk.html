<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">If you relied on us loading HP.HPTRIM.SDK.dll into the GAC you may have noticed that the 93 installer no longer does this, which has eliminated a number of messy deployment issues for us. For more information see the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/app-domains/gac">Microsoft guidelines</a> re GAC installation.</p>
<h1 style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The good news</h1>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">A key benefit of GAC installation was the ability to write version agnostic SDK applications, the good news is that you can still do this.  All you need to do is <a href="https://github.com/HPECM/Community/tree/master/Samples/SDK/CSharp/SDKLocationResolver">intercept the assembly loading pipeline</a> and you can specify that HP.HPTRIM.SDK.dll gets loaded from the location specified in the registry.</p>
