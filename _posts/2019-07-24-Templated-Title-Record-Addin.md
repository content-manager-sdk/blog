This new [sample add-in](https://github.com/content-manager-sdk/Community/tree/master/Samples/SDK/CSharp/SampleAddInCustomTitle) allows you to compose the Record Title from other properties and fields, replacing text in angle brackets with the matching property or field.

I have included a version agnostic downloadable [DLL](https://github.com/content-manager-sdk/Community/blob/master/Samples/SDK/CSharp/SampleAddInCustomTitle/DLL/SampleAddIn.zip) for those who want to try it 'as-is'.
