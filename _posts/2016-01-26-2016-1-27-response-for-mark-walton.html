<p>Had a question from Mark re a problem where the 'Search Clause Name' property on the Additional Field dialog is not appearing in the TRIM client.</p>
<p>I do not experience this behavior myself and I am not sure why it is happening.  Best course of action is to either submit a formal support request  or ask the question over at the support forum (http://community.hpe.com/t5/HPE-Records-Manager-and-HPE-TRIM/bd-p/itrc-1015#.Vqfh9yp97mE).  If asking the question on the forum include a picture and what sort of user you are logged in on.</p>
<p>BTW, the support forum is much more suitable for questions given the ability to reply to comments.</p>
