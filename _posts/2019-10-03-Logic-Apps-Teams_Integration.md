In a previous [post](/Logic-Apps-Custom-Connector/) I described my initial experiments with Microsoft Logic Apps.  For this post I have created a trigger on Content Manager so that the Logic App can react to modifications to Records.  To make this work I needed to make a small modification to the ServiceAPI code, this could be applied to an existing CM installation via a ServiceAPI plugin.

If you are interested in Logic Apps and would like some more resources just get in touch via the usual channels.
