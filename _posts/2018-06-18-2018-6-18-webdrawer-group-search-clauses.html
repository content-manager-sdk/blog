<p>Just added a new <a href="https://github.com/HPECM/Community/tree/master/Samples/WebDrawer/GroupSearches">sample</a> in the GitHub repo to allow for brackets in the standard WebDrawer search form.Â  The readme in the repo should be enough to install the sample but if you want to have a look without installing it yourself the video below demonstrates how to install and what it looks like.</p>
