For those who write .Net applications there is a new [Nuget package](https://github.com/content-manager-sdk/Community/tree/master/Samples/ServiceAPI/CSharp/ConsoleServiceAPIClient) and sample code to simplify the development process.  The package contains both .Net 45 and standard assemblies so is of use in most .Net scenarios (e.g. native Windows, .Net Core, Xamarin).
