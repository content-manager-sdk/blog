<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Recently I posted re some research we have done into <a href="/blog/2018/7/25/google-docs-add-on">Google Docs</a> and <a href="/blog/2018/7/17/gmail-addon">Gmail </a>integration.  This post shows the result of similar research into building add-ons for Microsoft Office Online.</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Online versions of Office applications are different to the native versions in some not so subtle ways, for example in Office Online your document is saved very frequently, also collaborative editing is encouraged, this impacts the design of a Content Manager add-on.   </p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Currently we have a our SharePoint integration and the Web Client Office Online integration, so any potential Office Web add-on needs to be designed to solve a meaningful business problem.  It is even conceivable that Email Link might provide a sufficient server side solution.</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you have an interest in Office add-ons get in touch via the usual channels.</p>
