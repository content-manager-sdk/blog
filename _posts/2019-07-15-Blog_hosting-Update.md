### Blog update

As of Monday 15th July 2019 I have moved the hosting for this web site from Squarespace to Github pages.  The main motivation for this was to consolidate with our [samples repo](https://github.com/content-manager-sdk/Community).  The only annoyance I see for readers of this blog are:
 1. links to individual posts have changed, all posts can be found in the index
 2. the RSS feed link as changed, select the RSS link at the bottom of the page to subscribe to this blog.
