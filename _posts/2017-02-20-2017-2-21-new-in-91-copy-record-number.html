<p>Some months ago I jumped on the train to Geelong to attend the TRIM User Group.  It is great to catch up with real live 'Content /Records Manager / TRIM' users.  One simple enhancement that was suggested at this meeting was the ability to copy a record number from the confirm dialog. So here it is in 9.1 patch 1...</p>

<h1>Caveat</h1>
<p dir="ltr">If a portion of the number requires manual input then only the manual portion will be copied.  I am reliably informed that this will be fixed in 9.1 patch 2.</p>
