<p>The <a href="http://docs.servicestack.net/java-add-servicestack-reference#jsonserviceclient-api">ServiceStack client</a> we use to connect to the ServiceAPI from Java builds a set of classes to simply creating and requesting objects but it has no facility to upload an electronic document. Â Given the diversity of HTTP libraries in the Java world this probably makes sense.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://github.com/HPECM/Community/tree/master/Samples/ServiceAPI/Java/SampleFileUpload">sample </a>demonstrates uploading a file using the Apache <a href="https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/">HttpClient</a>.</p>
