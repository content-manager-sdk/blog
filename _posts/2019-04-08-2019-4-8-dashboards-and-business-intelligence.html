<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Last week I took some time out of my schedule to experiment with Power BI.  While Power BI can access many data sources, including a JSON/REST web service such as the ServiceAPI, it is simplest to access data sources for which a connector exists.  This led me to experiment with Power Query custom connectors.</p>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The connector I show in the video below is not production ready but is far enough along to demonstrate its viability.  Before proceeding I would like some feedback from anyone who might use this to answer questions like:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Is Power BI of interest?</p></li>
<li><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What data would you want to extract from CM in Power BI?</p></li>
<li><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What sort of Dashboards / Reports would you produce?</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One nice thing about a custom connector is that it could quite easily be backwards compatible, so would work with existing CM implementations.</p>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you have any interest in this space and want to see this experiment go further send me a private message at the <a href="https://community.microfocus.com/t5/Content-Manager-User-Discussions/bd-p/itrc-1015">CM Forum</a>.</p>
