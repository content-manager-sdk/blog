<p>The big thing I love about getting out to of the office is hearing from our partners and customers about how they use HPE CM.  Meeting face to face helps a backroom person like me feel the passion attached to some of the feature requests we get through the usual channels.  It is not unusual to hear something like 'I have wanted feature X for years but it never seems to make the cut' and then be able to toss that into the mix in our next team meeting and find it is something that fits well into our next release.</p>
<p>So I look forward to catching up in just over a week with anyone who can get to <a href="http://www.cvent.com/events/information-management-governance-forum-2017/event-summary-b15a27a704434ca2be2f96ee686150a1.aspx">IMGF </a>here in Australia.</p>
