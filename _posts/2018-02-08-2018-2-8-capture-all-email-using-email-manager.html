<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Occasionally you might want to capture all email sent by (and to) particular users.  This is achieved using a combination of Exchange Journaling and the Content Manager 'Email Management' module. </p>
<h1>Details</h1>
<p>There are a few things that need to be done in order to use the Email Management import tool, these are:</p>
<ol>
<li>setup an SMTP server which can store incoming email in a drop folder, probably the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8b83ac7t(v=vs.100).aspx">IIS SMTP server</a>,</li>
<li>configure <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa998649(v=exchg.160).aspx">journaling </a>on your Exchange server to journal email to your SMTP server, and</li>
<li>configure an Origin in Content Manager to monitor the drop folder on the SMTP server.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Watch</h1>
<p>In this video I take a tour of Content Manager Email Management installed on an Azure VM and using Exchange Email Online.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> In the video I state the bulk loading is not supported when using SQL Azure.  I am reliably informed that this has been fixed in Content Manager 9.2.</p>
