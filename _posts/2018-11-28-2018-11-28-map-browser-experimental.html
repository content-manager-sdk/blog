<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It was fun to take a few days recently (along with some colleagues) to do some experimental work on browsing Records on a map.  The app below is strictly experimental, if you have any interest in this sort of thing lodge an enhancement request and tell me what your support request number is so that I can follow it up.</p>
