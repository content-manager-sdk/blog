<p>Event processor add-ins are great for responding to events on the workgroup server but and now we can optimise them to only respond to the events (and object types) that we are interested in.  Use the 'Configure Events' button in the  'Custom Processes' tab in Enterprise Studio, or watch this video for more information.  For more details on the event processor addins see my <a href="/blog/2015/7/26/a-first-event-processor-add-in">previous post</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/HPECM/Community/tree/master/Samples/SDK/CSharp/EventProcessor">sample</a>.</p>
