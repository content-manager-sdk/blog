<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">By default DataPort imports a tab delimited file.  What is less well known is that you can write your own formatter to import an arbitrary file format.  In this <a href="https://github.com/HPECM/Community/tree/master/Samples/SDK/CSharp/DataPortCustomFormatter">sample</a> I import a very simple XML file.  Even though the XML file itself is simple it is a little more complex to import than a tab delimited file due to the fact that it does not follow the essentially columnar layout of a tab delinted file.</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">We also have the code for our standard <a href="https://github.com/HPECM/Community/tree/master/Samples/SDK/CSharp/DataPortFormatter">tab delimited formatter</a> in the GitHub repo.</p>
