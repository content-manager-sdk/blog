<p>Prior to Content Manager 9.0 there was no supported Java client for the ServiceAPI, although I did publish an experimental project.  As of 9.0 we are able to use the ServiceStack Java client.  This video demonstrates that client. </p>

<h1>The code</h1>
<p>The sample project I created in the video is on our <a href="https://github.com/HPECM/Community/tree/master/Samples/ServiceAPI/Java/MyTestConsole">samples site</a>. Beware, in the video I omit the call to 'setAlwaysSendBasicAuthHeaders', you should always call this when using basic authentication.</p>
