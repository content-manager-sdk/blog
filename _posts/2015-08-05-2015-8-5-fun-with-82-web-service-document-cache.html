<p>In this, the latest in my series on <a href="/blog?tag=82">fun stuff in 82</a>, I examine the new option for a larger web service document cache.</p>

<p>This new setting affects the document cache used by the ServiceAPI, WebClient and WebDrawer allowing them all to cache a larger number of documents locally.  For the developers out there you can also take advantage of this simply by calling TrimApplication.SetAsWebService("c:\\SOME_PATH"); at the start of your web service.</p>
