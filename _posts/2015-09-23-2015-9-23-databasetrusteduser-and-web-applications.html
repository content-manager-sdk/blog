<h1>Background</h1>
<p>When building a client side SDK application authentication is rarely anissue, you simply connect your database and allow it to connect using the user's credentials.  Server side applications can be a little more complex and require some form of impersonation.</p>
<h1>.Net impersonation</h1>
<p>In the past when we have built web application or web services we have sometimes relied on <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa292118(v=vs.71).aspx">.Net impersonation</a>.  This allows us to impersonate the credentials used by the browser (assuming authentication is enabled in IIS but has a few issues, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>challenges when using multiple domains,</li>
<li>inability to plug in 3rd party authentication providers, and</li>
<li>without careful design a requirement to allow all impersonated users access to the server operating system.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Database.ConnectAs()</h1>
<p>The Database object has a method called ConnectAs(), which due to the fact that you must pass the username and password is of limited value.</p>
<h1>Database.SpawnImpersonatedDatabase()</h1>
<p>To the best of my knowledge this exists only for backwards compatibility, I do not recommend using it.</p>
<h1>Database.TrustedUser</h1>
<p>This is where you should be if you are creating a server side application, such as a web site or web service.  TrustedUser requires that the credentials used to run the application have permission to impersonate other users, there are two ways for a user account to have this permission, if it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>the same account used to run the workgroup server, or</li>
<li>an account registered in 'trusted server accounts' in Enterprise Studio.</li>
</ul>
<p>For an IIS web application that user that must have this permission is the Identity used by the Application Pool attached to the IIS application.</p>
<p>Once you are running as one of these users then you can impersonate any RM user like this:</p>
<pre class="source-code"><span class="cm-tag">using</span> (<span class="cm-tag">Database</span> <span class="cm-tag">database</span> = <span class="cm-tag">new</span> <span class="cm-tag">Database</span>())
{
    <span class="cm-property cm-error">database</span><span class="cm-error">.Id</span> = <span class="cm-string">"H1"</span>;
    <span class="cm-property cm-error">database</span><span class="cm-error">.WorkgroupServerName</span> = <span class="cm-string">"local"</span>;
    <span class="cm-property cm-error">database</span><span class="cm-error">.TrustedUser</span> = <span class="cm-string">"PersonA"</span>;
    <span class="cm-property cm-error">database</span><span class="cm-error">.Connect</span>();
}</pre>
