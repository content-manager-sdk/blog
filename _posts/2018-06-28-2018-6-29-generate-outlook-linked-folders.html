<h1>Background</h1>
<p>Prior to CM 9.0 the Outlook integration had a feature to export/import linked folders, at that time linked folders were stored in the Windows registry so the import/export was required any time a user received a new machine.  This feature was also of use to those who wished to share their linked folders with their friends.</p>
<p>In 9.0 the architecture of the Outlook integration changed so that linked folders were stored in Checkin Style objects (in Content Manager) not in the registry, which seemed to make the import/export unnecessary, except for that sharing with friends usage.</p>
<h1>A partial solution</h1>
<p>A partial solution to sharing linked folders is to create Checkin Styles which have a group as the owner, this means that every member of that group will see that Checkin Style.  The gap is that a linked folder will not be auto-created for that Checkin Style.</p>
<h1>Some sample code</h1>
<p>I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/HPECM/Community/tree/master/Samples/SDK/CSharp/Outlook%20Linked%20Folder%20generator">sample application</a> that could be the basis for a utility to allow users to create linked folders from Checkin Styles that have been created for them.  This might useful in the case where the user has multiple Checkin Styles and does not wish to go through one by one to create a new linked folder for each one.  Below is a screen shot from this sample application.</p>

<h1>The future</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Clearly if the sharing of linked folders is a popular activity then it makes sense to bring it back in some form.  If you want to have input on how that should be implement lodge a support request or send me a <a href="https://community.softwaregrp.com/t5/notes/composepage">private message</a> on the forums.</p>
