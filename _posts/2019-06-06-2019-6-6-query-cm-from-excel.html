<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One of the outputs from my recent experimentation with PowerBI and Power Query is this <a href="https://github.com/content-manager-sdk/Community/tree/master/Samples/ServiceAPI/Power%20Query/Saved%20Search%20Query">saved search connector</a>.  I do not spend much time in Excel myself but I know that it is popular out there in the real world.  If you would like to see something more/different contact me on the <a href="https://community.microfocus.com/t5/Content-Manager-User-Discussions/bd-p/itrc-1015">forum </a>or through the usual channels.</p>
