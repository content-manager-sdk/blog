[Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) is a new Microsoft technology for building client web apps in C#.  I have spent a total of 2 hours experimenting with it so here is my beginners intro.  If you are interested and want to save the 2 hours I spent hacking together some CM SDK code you can find [my project](https://github.com/content-manager-sdk/Community/tree/master/Samples/SDK/CSharp/BlazorApp) on the samples repo.
