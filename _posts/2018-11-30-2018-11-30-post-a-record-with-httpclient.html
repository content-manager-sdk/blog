<html><body><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">If you are not using the full .Net framework, maybe you have a .Net standard library in a Xamarin application, then you will not have access to System.net.WebClient.  In place of this use System.Net.Http.HttpClient.  This <a href="https://github.com/HPECM/Community/tree/master/Samples/ServiceAPI/CSharp/RecordCreationWithHttpClient">new sample</a> is a very simple console app demonstrating how to post a JSON request.</p></body></html>
