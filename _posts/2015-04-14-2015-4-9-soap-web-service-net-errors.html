<h1>What is a .Net Error?</h1>
<p dir="ltr">It can be the case, especially on a new installation of the SOAP web service, that the .Net framework is not correctly configured.  This might result in an error a little like the one below.</p>
  
      <img src="/squarespace_images/static_5525c843e4b0788926c29a33_5525f2dce4b09e5532140872_552625a5e4b09e553214b30d_1428563366706__img.png_" alt="">
  

<p>The error above is the result of something that has happened before the SOAP web service has even managed to load.</p>
<h1>Fixing the problem</h1>
<p>Depending on the error there might be a number of underlying problems.  One common problem is that ASP.Net is not correctly registered.  In the case of an error similar to the one above it cannot hurt to try this:</p>
<ol>
<li>go to C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319</li>
<li>run aspnet_regiis -u</li>
<li>run aspnet_regiis -i -enable</li>
<li>in IIS Manager ensure that your application pool is set to v4.0</li>
<li>this should install ASP.Net and might fix your problem.</li>
</ol>
