In Content Manager 10 a new OpenId authentication module was added to CM web service applications (Web Client, ServiceAPI and WebDrawer). This module supports authentication for Azure AD, ADFS and Google.  Instructions for configuring this can be found in the [SDK documentation](https://content-manager-sdk.github.io/Community/10/oidc.html) but if you would like to watch me funble my way through setting up OpenId for ADFS you can do so in the below video.
