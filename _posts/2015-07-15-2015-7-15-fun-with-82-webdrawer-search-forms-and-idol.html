<h1>Fun with HPRM 82</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Having spent quite a few hours reviewing, testing and playing with HPRM  82 I thought I would share some of my favourite things.  These are mostly technical things so you are unlikely to find me expounding on some great new records management feature, talk to support or sales for that.  This is the first in the series.</p>
<h1>Searching in WebDrawer</h1>
<p>A combination of some new features in HPRM 82 allow you to add something a little bit like a Google search to WebDrawer, all without writing any code.</p>
