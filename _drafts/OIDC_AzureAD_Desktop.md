### Configure Azure AD for Office Integration access

The office integration requires an access token to allow it ro authenticate with the Web Client, this can be configured in Azure AD:

1. create an Azure App for Web Authentication, you may use the one you created to authenticate with the CM Web Client,
1. create (or edit) the file ADFS\config.xml in your CM Web Client installation folder and set it as follows:
   * clientAuthority - 'https://login.windows.net/' followed by your domain: e.g. https://login.windows.net/cmofficedev.onmicrosoft.com
   * clientResourceUri - the Application ID URI from your CM Web Client Azure App
   * clientID - the Application Id from your CM Desktop Azure App
   * clientReturnUri - urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob

#### Example Config

```xml
<adfsClient>
<clientAuthority>https://login.windows.net/cmofficedev.onmicrosoft.com</clientAuthority>
<clientResourceUri>api://auchurchla02:3000/09f0ec5c-87e9-4568-8b60-4eb3e20de75e</clientResourceUri>
